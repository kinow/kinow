- 🇪🇸 I am based in Barcelona, Spain. Previously I was living in 🇳🇿 Auckland, New Zealand. I am originally from 🇧🇷 Casa Verde, São Paulo, Brazil.
- 👯 Feel free to get in contact to discuss collaboration in Open Source, I am interested in several topics, from image processing, fuzzy logic, and natural language processing, to workflows, devops, continuous integration, and testing.
- 🌱 I am an Apache Software Foundation member, and also involved with other Open Source projects such as TestLink, Jenkins, BioUno, TAP, Smashing, TupiLabs, CWL, and others.
