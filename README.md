### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I am currently working on Cylc, a workflow manager written in Python that runs cyclic workflows
- 🇳🇿 I am based in Auckland, New Zealand, but am originally from São Paulo, Brazil 🇧🇷
- 👯 Feel free to get in contact to discuss collaboration in Open Source, I am interested in several topics, from image processing, fuzzy logic, and natural language processing, to devops, continuous integration, and testing
- ⚡ Also interested in topics that are not necessarily related to programming, such as writing, science fiction, judo, slackline, and history
